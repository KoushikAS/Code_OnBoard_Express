Gen AI Team 9 OnBoard Express
Imagine if you didn't have to wait a month for new employees to get acquainted with your codebase or workflow.
Imagine if your product managers didn't need to wait for briefing from the developers for every major change.
Imagine if technical support didn't have to wait for the engineer to get back for every detail to help your client out.

With onboard express we plan to do exactly that. Reducing the turnaround time by creating targeted summaries/flows of your codebase without human intervention.

So that your new hire can get involved in the development process quicker. Clients get their issues resolved faster. 

So people can do what they are best at- "create".
