# Code OnBoard Express

## Overview

Welcome to **Code OnBoard Express** a revolutionary tool designed to streamline the onboarding process in tech environments. Imagine a world where new employees don't have to spend weeks getting acquainted with your codebase or workflow. Picture a scenario where product managers receive instant briefings on major changes without waiting for developer input. Envision technical support resolving client issues swiftly without always relying on engineering feedback.

OnBoard Express is here to turn these imaginations into reality.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Onboarding**: Accelerates the process for new hires to understand and engage with your codebase.
- **Automated Summaries**: Creates targeted summaries and flow diagrams of your codebase without human intervention.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Enables team members to focus on creative and critical aspects of development.

## Getting Started

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

At the core of OnBoard Express lies our innovative use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This cutting-edge technology is instrumental in empowering our tool with the following capabilities:

- Dynamic Information Integration: RAG pipelines enable OnBoard Express to dynamically incorporate relevant external information into its processing. This means our tool is not just limited to the static data it was trained on but can adapt and learn from the evolving tech landscape.
- Enhanced Understanding of Codebases: Through the use of RAG, OnBoard Express gains a deeper comprehension of various coding languages and frameworks. This is crucial for generating accurate summaries and flow diagrams.
- Real-time Learning and Adaptation: The RAG technology allows OnBoard Express to continuously learn from new data sources. This ensures that the summaries and insights provided are always up-to-date with the latest coding practices and industry standards.

By leveraging RAG pipelines, we ensure that OnBoard Express remains at the forefront of AI-driven onboarding solutions, providing an unmatched experience to our users in the tech industry.
