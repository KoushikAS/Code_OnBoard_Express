The code imports necessary modules and defines a function called "receive_connection". This function sets up a socket connection, receives XML data, and processes it based on its content. If the XML is in the "create" format, it creates a new account or symbol. If the XML is in the "transactions" format, it performs actions such as placing an order, canceling an order, or querying an account. If the XML does not follow the expected format, an exception is raised. The code also includes a main block that calls the "receive_connection" function.The code imports necessary modules and defines a function called "receive_connection".
